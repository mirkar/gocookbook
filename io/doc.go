//
//Go provides excellent support for both basic and complex I/O. The recipes in this package will explore common
//Go interfaces that are used to deal with I/O and show you how to make use of them.
//
//Notes:
//
//These recipes should lay the foundation for the use of interfaces to represent and modify data, and should help you
//think about data in an abstract and flexible way.
//
//	* IO with readers and writers
//	* The io.Reader interface
//	* Working with directories and files
//	* Working with the CSV format.
//	* Working with temporary files.
//	* Working with text/template and html/template
